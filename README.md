## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

These will be provided in the solution uploaded to FEM

## My process

I figured since the design in desktop seemed more complicated I did start with the design for a large screen first and then when finished I just had to add a few modifications in the css media query to sort of acheive the desired design for mobile

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (as much as I could)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I had it quite difficult to be able to vertically center aling the main element to start building my flex box from there. I tried using the transform attribute but I woulnd't let me center algin the box. I had to look into some other projects to find how they acheived it and that how I did it this time. Still trying to learn and understand a better approach to this.

I did learn that using fixed dimessions such as width and height will mess me up when I try to use the media queries later on. I learnt I should use relative values for better responsiveness. I just didn't wanna go back and start over with this project so I left it as it is. Will definitely take that into account from the start in my next challenge.

I'm aware I'm not documenting nor organizing my code very well. Will also try doing so in my next challenge.
